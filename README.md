# GitTest-Steele

Hello Nick, and welcome to the repository.

I have created this to show you what you're meant to be doing here in GitHub. This repository is the most basic element of the web design phase of the project. In this repository, we will store the website html file. It can be taken out and edited with the commands that are taught by this YouTube video. This method allows us to work cooperatively and resolve conflicts on the go. The only thing is that it requires a little bit of learning of the command prompt. Don't be scared by this, it's pretty easy. Watch the entirety of the video, as it will explain to you what we're going to do to write the project and what we're going to do to resovle conflicts. If you see a conflict as in the thingy, the system we'll use is just a quick inbox, saying "what was this change" or "why did you do this to the code" just so we're on the same page. If you can pick up why I've made a change, just confirm it in your doc. Otherwise, send a message and I will confirm the change.

The text editor that I've chosen is the one in the video, as it's a bit nicer to use than Notepad++ which was my previous favourite text editor. Eventually we can advance to dreamweaver as that basically just allows for a live preview of the code, whereas this doesn't. We may need to advance to dreamweaver when we get onto the CSS. For now, to preview, just drag and drop the .html file into the browser of your choice.

All good, thanks for reading this lel
