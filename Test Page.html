	<h1> Nathan Cappelluti </h1>
		<p> Hello all, and welcome to the testing blog which I have created with a high school friend of mine, Nick. Unfortunately he is not as witty as I and is learning HTML also. The purpose of this blog was for us to teach ourselves basic web development skills for the future, as the world is certainly shifting in a direction which makes computer skills more important. </p>
	<h3> Reasons I created this blog </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> To teach myself the skills necessary for very basic web development. </li>
			<li> To have fun, of course </li>
			<li> To keep myself relevant in a world where computer skills are becoming more and more important </li>
		</ul>
